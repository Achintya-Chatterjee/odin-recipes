    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        mutton kasha is an iconic Bengali delicacy. The word kasha is similar in meaning to bhuna, which involves slowly cooking a gravy over low flame for a very long time to get a rich, dark-brown gravy and melt-in-the-mouth mutton pieces. It is worth pointing out that in Bengal, as well as in India, mutton is commonly used to refer to goat’s meat. Mutton kasha (or kasha mangsho) can be served with porota or polao. It tastes great even with plain rice. One of the most famous shops selling this style of mutton kasha is Golbari at the Shyambazar crossing in Calcutta. While we are not certain that our version is exactly like Golbari’s, we can assure you it certainly tastes very good.
