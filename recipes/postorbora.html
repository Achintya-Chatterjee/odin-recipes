    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>After trying all the recipes, we have realized that each variation adds a lovely twist to the postor bora. Hence, instead of presenting one ultimate postor bora recipe, we decided to show all the major variations that we found out about. Starting with the grinding method to the choice of adding fillers and flavours, each step can be done in a number of ways. We have listed out more than one way, letting you choose whichever you think suits your taste, day, and mood the best. We don't like cooking exactly the same way everyday. So just knowing all these variations that are possible makes everyday food a lot more exciting</p>
